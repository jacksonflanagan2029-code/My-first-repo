One of my favorite hobbies is working with money and learnig more about the financial side of life. 
I began to take an intrest in this after I joined the VE program back in middle school. 
The amount of time that I spend on it varies but I'll sometimes talk to my parents about the financial state of our country or the world. This can last up to an **hour!**
I like this hobby because I get to learn more about money which helps me in the long run and I have an interest in math as well which connects to it. 
I have learned new things such as strategies to save money or how to spend it or save it. 
In 8th grade, I got into the finance department within the VE program. This also taught me a lot about how to manage finances and what to prioritize.
